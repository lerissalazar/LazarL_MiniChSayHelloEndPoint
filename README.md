Open up the program, run it by pressing f5. Then copy the URL and paste it into postman, add in the Controller name and the Route name ("SayHello/Hello"). 
Enter your name after the slash and the computer should enter in a sentence "Hello, (name).

peer review: Marcel R. Program ran smooth, asked for a string and placed my name as the input. Output my name saying hello. It was nice to see :)
